# 🧾 Risk Register Lab – NIST CSF (Identify Function)

## 📌 Purpose

This lab demonstrates how to create a basic risk register aligned with the **Identify** function of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). The goal is to simulate a foundational risk assessment process for a small organization or environment.

## 📋 Risk Register Overview

The risk register documents potential cybersecurity risks, assigns values for **likelihood** and **impact**, and proposes **mitigation strategies**. This structured format helps prioritize threats and improve decision-making.

### 🔒 Sample Risk Entries

| Risk ID | Description               | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score (L×I) | Mitigation Strategy                       |
|---------|---------------------------|------------|--------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| R-001   | Unpatched software        | Medium     | High   | 9                | Implement monthly patching policy         |
| R-002   | Weak access controls      | High       | High   | 12               | Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) |
| R-003   | Phishing email threats    | High       | Medium | 9                | Security awareness training for employees |

> 💡 Risk scores are based on a 1–5 scale for both Likelihood and Impact (1 = Low, 5 = High).
