# 🔐 NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Labs & Projects

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of practical, hands-on cybersecurity labs and mini-projects mapped to the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0**. The goal is to simulate real-world scenarios using open-source tools and to document each lab in a clear, repeatable, and informative way.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- 📚 **Apply NIST CSF concepts** in real-world cybersecurity environments.
- ⚙️ **Use industry tools** (Wazuh, Zeek, TheHive, YARA, etc.) across all CSF Functions.
- 📁 **Create 20+ labs/projects** to showcase in a professional GitHub portfolio.
- 📄 **Document clearly** using Markdown, diagrams, risk assessments, and logs.
- 🚀 **Build a roadmap** for cybersecurity learning and job-readiness.
