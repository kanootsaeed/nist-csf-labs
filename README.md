# 🔐 NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Labs & Projects

This repository showcases a series of hands-on cybersecurity labs aligned with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0**. Each lab applies real-world scenarios and open-source tools to demonstrate GRC principles in action — with a focus on documentation, risk awareness, and operational security.

## 🧠 About the Project

These labs are designed to:
- Apply key NIST CSF functions to real-world use cases
- Build a professional, portfolio-ready GitHub presence
- Highlight governance, risk management, and threat detection capabilities

## 👤 About Me

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong interest in **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)**. After completing the **Security+ certification**, I began building this lab portfolio to demonstrate my ability to apply the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** in practical scenarios.

My work emphasizes:
- Risk-based thinking
- Clear documentation
- Hands-on use of tools like Nmap, Excel, Python, and GitHub

I'm currently seeking entry-level opportunities in **GRC**, **risk analysis**, or **cybersecurity compliance** roles.

## ✅ Completed Labs

### 1. 📦 Asset Inventory with Nmap
**Function:** Identify  
**Overview:** Used Nmap to discover and document active hosts and services in a test environment. Screenshots and scan results are included to simulate asset inventory processes.

### 2. 🧾 Risk Register with Excel & Markdown
**Function:** Govern  
**Overview:** Created a basic risk register aligned with the NIST CSF Identify Function. Risks are scored by likelihood and impact, and visualized using Python-based matrix and heatmap tools.  
Includes:
- Excel version of the risk register  
- Risk matrix scatter plot  
- Risk heatmap for visual prioritization
